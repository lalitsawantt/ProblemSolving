Given two strings, check whether one is the permutation of the other.
For example : 

1.

string 1 = hello world
string 2 = wrold olhle

here, the strings are permutations of each other since they contain the same characters.

2.

string 1 = hello world
string 2 = chocolate

here, the strings are not permutations of each other since they do not contain the same characters.
